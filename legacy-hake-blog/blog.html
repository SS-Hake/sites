				<h4>Delays and Ideas</h4>
				<h6>01/05/15</h6>
				<p>
					I've fallen behind a bit on my "one site every two days" goal the past week due to travel and university work,
					so I've tried to spend some time thinking about potential sites and projects I can work on this weekend.
				</p>

				<h4>Week 2</h4>
				<h6>26/04/15</h6>
				<p>
					This week centred around the creation of a few more jQuery apps, testing out Angular with a simple one page
					app, and the prototype of a small javascript library I would like to publish named Twilight.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started the week with three more slightly more complex canvas apps, which incorporated collisions and some
					more complex maths.  This is nothing I haven't dealt with before, but I feel like the correct pacing while learning
					Javascript/jQuery will make me aware of more of their intricacies.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Last week I found the <a href="http://ss-hake.github.io/pages/particlesTest.html">Particles.js</a>library, which 
					really opened my eyes to how easy it was to create a useful and interesting library with javascript, so I began 
					work on my own this week. <a href="http://ss-hake.github.io/pages/twilight.html">Twilight.js</a> is still in the
					early stages but I have created the basis for an active background which simulates a warm summers 
					evening (inspired by the evening of the 19th April 2015) using a canvas element.  The background features randomly 
					generated twinkling stars and planets of various sizes, as well as randomly generated, animated planes and 
					satellites which move accross the sky.
				</p>
				<p>
					While working on Twilight.js towards the end of the week I also completed my goals from last week's post by testing
					AngularJS with a simple app which displays different information through interaction with different HTML elements. 
				</p>	
				<p>
					Goals for next week are to add random shooting stars to Twilight.js as well as adding support for an 
					initialisation file which sets different variables such as plane and satellite frequency and the background colour 
					of the canvas.  Once that is complete, some final tweaking is all that will be required before publication of my 
					first Javascript library on Github!  Once that is complete I will be able to focus more on my AngularJS development
					and start looking at methods to incorporate persistent data into my apps, allowing for the development of more 
					useful apps like shopping lists, etc!

				<h4>Week 1</h4>	
				<h6>18/04/15</h6>
				<p>
					So, it's the end of my first week.  I wanted to spend this week getting used to
					web development again, creating a few apps which just selected some elements and did something 
					with them. The most basic concept of jQuery is to <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/"> "select some elements and do something with them"</a>,   
					so jQuery seemed like a good starting point!
				<p>
					I've made 6 apps so far, I started with a very simple script which handled the cursor entering a 
					large selection of square divs I had created manually by copy-pasting HTML elements.  I ended the 
					week with an app which uses a wrapper library on top of jQuery to automate the generation and animation 
					of 1000 divs, I'm quite happy with that progression.  Along the way, I've been re-learning the basic 
					concepts of Javascript and learning a lot more about jQuery, as well as little tips and tricks I hadn't heard
					before.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first of these tips was to use CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) to host my Javascript libraries.
					I found <a href="http://encosia.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you/"
					>this interesting post</a> which extolled the virtues of letting <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/">Google host your libraries for you</a>.  Adding the little tag pointing to the host's
					library, rather than a copy I am hosting, results in faster loading times, cross-site caching and when I get
					around to using them; benefits when using AJAX calls.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other tips and tricks cropped up as I was reading through the jQuery documentation. Things like <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/performance/append-outside-loop/">appending outside of loops</a> to increase performance 
					and reduce computationally costly DOM insertion.  Or, using #ID and element selectors where ever 
					possible, due to the fact that they are based on native DOM operations, which reduce search space that using 
					attribute or pseudo might entail.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the next week I plan to expand my usage of underscore and put out some more complex jQuery apps.  I've also found a <a href="https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/">
					cool library</a> for making particles I'd like to try out, so one of the week's apps will probably involve 
					that (although I will be forced to host it myself!).
