# Sites
A collection of websites I have created.

##1-Portfolio
My first Jekyll site.
A responsive, one page Jekyll site created to practice design  with Sass.
I used a range of resources such as Bourbon, bouncejs and fit text to provide a 
slick, responsive experience on devices of any screen size.

##2-Thompson-tutorials
My second Jekyll site.
A commissioned site providing information about a friends tutoring business.
Currently in progress.

A very basic, hand written, HTML, CSS, Javascript personal blog.
Used as a test bed for practice and tutorials with a range of Javascript libraries.
